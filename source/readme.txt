To compile the sources (Delphi7 version suggested) you also need 
SynEdit (http://synedit.sf.net), 
UniHighlighter (see link to that at "Third party files" section of SynEdit home website) 
and JCL & JVCL (http://jcl.sf.net, http://jvcl.sf.net) 

have fun
and give due credit at any derivative projects,
